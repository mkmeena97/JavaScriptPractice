<p> All standard built-in copy operations with any javascript objects create shallow copys, rather than deep copies. </p>

<h1>Shallow Copy</h1>
    <Ul>
    <li>A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references . <li>
    <li>As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change too.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Deep Copy</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not d=share the same reference.

        <li>
            when you change either source or the copy, it will not causing the other object to change too.
